        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Flour</strong>: All-purpose flour gives the banana bread structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Basking soda</strong>: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the banana bread rise.</li>
                <li><strong>Salt</strong>: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make the loaf taste salty.</li>
                <li><strong>Butter</strong>: A stick of butter lends richness, moisture, and irresistible flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Brown sugar</strong>: Brown sugar sweetens things up and adds a hinth of warmth.</li>
                <li><strong>Eggs</strong>: Eggs act as a binding agent, which means they hold the batter together.</li>
                <li><strong>Bananas</strong>: Of course, you'll need bananas! Choose overripe bananas.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>


        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Step 1</strong>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Farenheit. Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan</p>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Step 2</strong>
                    <p>Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Beat brown sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a separate 
                    large bowl until smooth. Stir in eggs and mashed bananas until well blended. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture 
                    until just combined. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Step 3</strong>
                    <p>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 60 minutes. 
                        Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
                    </p>
